# Personal Projects Lab

A workspace for experimenting, prototyping, and incubating new ideas. Projects start here as proof-of-concepts and graduate to their own repositories once they mature.

## Philosophy

This repository serves as a creative sandbox where:

- **New ideas are born** - Quick experiments and POCs live here
- **Concepts are validated** - Test feasibility before committing to full projects
- **Projects mature** - Develop until they're ready to stand alone
- **Graduation happens** - Successful projects move to dedicated repos

## Structure

```
me/
├── projects/          # Active POCs and experiments
│   ├── project-a/     # Early-stage exploration
│   └── project-b/     # Maturing concept
└── graduated/         # Links to projects that have their own repos
```

## Workflow

### Starting a New Project

1. Create a new directory in `projects/`
2. Build your POC with minimal structure
3. Focus on validating the core concept
4. Keep it simple and iterate quickly

### Graduating a Project

When a project is ready for its own repository:

1. Create a new dedicated Git repository
2. Move the project code to the new repo
3. Add a link in the `graduated/` section below
4. Clean up or remove from this repo

## Graduated Projects

Projects that have evolved into their own repositories:

- **[bengaluru-restoration-project](./bengaluru-restoration-project)** - Currently being set up as independent repo

## Guidelines

- Keep experiments lightweight and focused
- Don't over-engineer early POCs
- Graduate projects when they have clear direction
- Archive or delete failed experiments
- Document learnings in project READMEs

## Current Experiments

Check the `projects/` directory for active work.
