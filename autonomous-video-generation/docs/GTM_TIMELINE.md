## Capital Investment Timeline

### Truly Autonomous Operation

**One-Time Setup Investment** (Jan 11-26):
- Phase 0 validation: $50-100
- Building Claude Code skills: ~40 hours (one-time)
- System setup: ~10 hours (one-time)
- **Total Setup**: 50 hours + $50-100

**Ongoing Capital Investment** (Zero Labor):
- API costs only: $2.66/video
- Completely autonomous operation via:
  - Claude Code skills (idea generation, script writing, scene planning)
  - fal.ai (asset generation)
  - Remotion (video assembly)
  - YouTube API (publishing, analytics)
  - Reflection skill (optimization)
  - GitHub Actions or cron (scheduling)

**Monthly API Costs:**
- Month 1 (Phase 1): 58 videos × $2.66 = $154
- Month 2 (Phase 2): 83 videos × $2.66 = $221
- Month 3 (Phase 3): 93 videos × $2.66 = $247
- **3-Month Total**: $622

**Total Investment for 90-Day Monetization:**
- Setup: $50-100 (validation)
- API costs: $622 (videos)
- **Total Capital**: $672-722
- Setup time: 50 hours (one-time, not ongoing)

**This IS capital multiplication:**
- Ongoing operation requires ZERO labor
