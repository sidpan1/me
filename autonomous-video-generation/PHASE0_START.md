→ Start Phase 1 on Monday, January 26
→ Build full Claude Code skills infrastructure
→ Begin 1/day publishing, scaling to 3/day

### If PIVOT (40-59/100):
→ Test alternative theme (mehendi, kolam, clay art)
→ Run mini-validation (3-5 days, $20)
→ Make final decision by Jan 31

### If NO-GO (<40/100):
→ Document lessons learned
→ Celebrate avoiding $700 loss on wrong path!
→ Consider alternative business models (SaaS, agency, etc.)
→ Or pivot to completely different opportunity
